Class: Rogue - Assassin
Race: Goliath
## Backstory
Gjertrudovski had a difficult childhood. Neither of his parents showed up at his birth. Right from the start, he had to fend for himself. Gjertrudovski grew up alone on the rooftops because he had learned at an early age that he had to stay away from the streets. In his younger days, he became physically addicted to fresh pastries and started sneaking into the skylights of various bakeries around the capital to steal three-day-old school buns. He has always preferred old and hard pastries because they suited his dark and gloomy attitude. Gjertrudovski is no soyboy, so he never left behind the emo phase like Kusekæsp. It's not a phase; it's a lifestyle. Unfortunately, this addiction has led Gjertrudovski to develop both a gluten allergy and short-term memory loss. Gjertrudovski has always tried to do the right thing, but since he has an unlimited amount of steeze and a background as a skater boy, he chooses to go for a switch triple cork 1440 if he has the opportunity.

# Løytnant fuglefaen

Class: Monk - Way of the Drunken Master
Race: Aarakocra
## Backstory
Lieutenant Fuglefaen grew up in a poor district marked by heavy and immoral warfare. From an early age, he learned self-defense and the art of surviving alone with few resources. He has experienced both sides of war: terror, murder, shrapnel wounds, and an endless river of blood, but also humanity, rescue missions, and opposition groups. After a coup that has gone down in the history books, Lieutenant Fuglefaen leads an army of dedicated soldiers to create a better world free from the influences of war. After some time, he has found loyal allies worldwide to stop warfare but faces significant resistance from governments that only desire one thing: money. Fuglefaen and the allies realize that if they had wealth, they could buy out the governments and force them to give up warfare. As if by a Christmas miracle, Fuglefaen hears about an adventuring group hunting for riches. "Perhaps this is the path to wealth?" he thinks.
